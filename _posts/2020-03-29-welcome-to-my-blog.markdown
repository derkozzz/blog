This is the first post in my blog. Who am I? What is my blog about? Who might be interested in this blog? All these questions will be answered here.

Let’s get acquainted! My name is Dmitry Meshcheryakov and I have been working in game development industry for almost 10 years and 9 of them in the wonderful studio [Kefir](https://kefirgames.ru/). The most successful project I’ve worked on is mobile survival game Last Day on Earth ([iOS](https://apps.apple.com/us/app/last-day-on-earth-survival/id1241932094), [Android](https://play.google.com/store/apps/details?id=zombie.survival.craft.z&hl=en)). During these 10 years I have worked as an ordinary QA engineer, QA Lead at different projects and Head of QA and Customer Support. I want to share my experience that I got while I was working in these positions.

Generally I’m going to write about QA and cover such topics as: “When should you stop testing and push the project to release?”, “Test cases vs. checklists”, “How to organize beta-testing in mobile games”, etc, but sometimes I will cover customer support topics and global game development issues. The best result from this blog for me is your feedback. It would be great if you share your experience, ask questions or argue with me. Nice to meet you here! Stay tuned!
